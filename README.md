# YouTube-and-Spotify-Automation-project

The aim of this project is to try to link between the API of YouTube and Spotify in order to be able to create a spotify playlist of the videos liked in the YouTube account of the client.
In this reposotiry, you're going to find the main code under the "create_playlist.py" 

Before running the code, you have to fill both the json file, where you're going to refer to the client or your account's API credentials, so that google can access your account to retrieve the right data for the spotify uris. You can create the API and proceed to the API services from this link: https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application 

In the "secret.py" you have to fill the credentials for the Spotify part, which means the spotify token and the user Id. 

Once the credentials are filled you will have to run the code in your git. A link will appeared, you will just have to copy and past the code given by google after the authorization.
